# Circus Show sheet app

This is an interactive page for those who want to run the circus shows of extinction curse.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works

TODO:

* build app MVP
* Deploy app to github pages
* Create app as an iframe element to embed externally

## For Foundry use

Foundry allows journals to embed iframes, which means this app can be added to your own adventure.
TODO: Find out if it's possible to create a journal where we export the results for historical purposes?

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `pnpm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
