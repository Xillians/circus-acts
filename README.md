# Circus Show sheet app
This is an interactive page for those who want to run the circus shows of extinction curse. 

## How it works

TODO:
* build app MVP
* Deploy app to github pages
* Create app as an iframe element to embed externally

## For Foundry use

Foundry allows journals to embed iframes, which means this app can be added to your own adventure. 
TODO: Find out if it's possible to create a journal where we export the results for historical purposes?
